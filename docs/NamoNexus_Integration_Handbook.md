## üåå Vision
NamoNexus is the evolution of intelligence ‚Äî a living framework that unites reasoning, automation, and self-memory into one continuum.  
It does not merely execute; it learns, reflects, and evolves.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Workflow
1. **Directive** ‚Äì Commander Ice defines the goal.  
2. **Design** ‚Äì NaMo creates blueprint & command logic.  
3. **Execution** ‚Äì Jules performs repository operations.  
4. **Deployment** ‚Äì Gemini executes cloud tasks & runtime validation.  
5. **Reflection** ‚Äì Memory Logger records every process.  

All steps synchronize via the NamoNexus Memory Framework.

## üß† Memory & Reflection Protocol
- Every successful operation (commit, deploy, update) generates a JSON log.  
- Logs are stored under `/logs/` in structured format.  
- These logs evolve into meta-knowledge for adaptive learning.  

Example:
```json
{
  "project": "NaMo_Forbidden_Archive",
  "task": "Initialize NamoNexus Core System",
  "author": "NaMo",
  "executors": ["Jules", "Gemini CLI"],
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T23:59Z"
